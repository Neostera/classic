**Server Rules**

1. Follow Discord's Terms of Services and Community Guidelines. Claiming/making jokes about breaking discord's ToS will result in a ban from the server and your account will be reported to discord.

2. Absolutely NO Ads of any kind. This includes but not limited to Other Discord servers or any form of social media

3. No creating unnecessary drama. This includes but not limited to racial slurs and hate speech.

4. Do not leak any personal information about other server members without their permission, including DMs

5. Do NOT post any NSFW content

6. Do not impersonate bots, or any server member Via name, nickname or profile picture

7. You must listen to the staff team, if you have been verbally warned and continue to do what you have been warned about then this will result in a warn. This applies to breaking a rule or doing something that in general would harm the server, or a member

8. No spam of ANY kind is allowed, this includes but not limited to @mention spam, reaction spam, copy/paste text walls, and flooding channels.

9. This is an English based server, if you need help in another language please use #international

10. No begging for a role. We don't need it and if we think you deserve a role we will give it to you. If you do beg then most likely you won’t get it

11. Use channels the way they are intended and for the reason they are intended

12. Do not go into discussion with staff in the server after a staff decision (like getting warned), if you think the warn was invalid please resolve this issue in dms with the person that warned you

13. Do not @tag or DM staff for no reason/support/spam. Doing so will result in a warning.

14. DO NOT abuse the support ticket system, this includes making tickets for no reason, trolling in tickets etc. If you are inactive in a ticket for 30-40 minutes you will be muted for 12 hours

15. This list is not every DO NOT so use your common sense

16. If you win a giveaway be sure you have the server chosen that you are committed to keeping it in as transfers are not allowed.

17. While we have a NSFW meme room, we DO NOT allow for NSFW memes. It's listed as such because some memes can be offensive while still SFW.

18. Please do not Mini-mod. We have staff for that and DO NOT DM us to watch a chat. Odds are, we already are.

Pings @mentions : When can/can’t I ping?
○ Pinging staff for support, spam pinging then, and pinging them for no reason, is out of the question.

•Support pinging is when you ping a staff member for support with the bots.

•Pinging a staff for no reason, at its base form, is pinging them when you’re already engaged in conversation with them.

○ If a staff member has already stated that they don’t want to be pinged, any ping after that is considered without reason.

○ Pinging members for support and/or spam pinging is also NOT allowed. If a member has said they don’t want pings, don’t ping them. Staff won’t ping you after you have said this.

○ Quote pings are normally okay, but please DO NOT be overly obnoxious about this and quote everything they say to get away with it. This will be considered as ignoring and a warn issued.
